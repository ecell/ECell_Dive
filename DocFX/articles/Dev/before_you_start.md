# Before you start...

This documentation aims to give a comprehensive understanding of how _ECellDive_ is currently implemented so that anyone can copy assets for their own projects or contribute to the project independantly.

However, _ECellDive_ is still considered in alpha stages and parts of the code base might be refactored several times. As a general guideline, we will try to keep the explanations you will find in this *Guidance* section matching any minor version number update. Currently, _ECellDive_ versioning follows the classic format **vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-stage**. Hence, a release update from **v0.11.5-alpha** to **v0.11.6-alpha** will not contain an update of this section. A release update from **v0.11.5-alpha** to **v0.12.X-alpha** or above will, however.

In this section, we will try to answer the following questions:
- What are the general coding guidelines? (coming soon)
- How are action modules implemented? (coming soon)
- How to contribute to _ECellDive_ by adding new modules? (coming soon)
- How works the multiplayer code? (coming soon)
- How works the _Dive Scene_ system? (coming soon)
- What makes a _Player_? (coming soon)
- What makes the UI menu? (coming soon)
- and probably others...
