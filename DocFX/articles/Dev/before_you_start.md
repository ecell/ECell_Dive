This documentation aims to give a comprehensive understanding of how _ECellDive_ is currently implemented so that anyone can copy assets for their own projects or contribute to the project independantly.

However, _ECellDive_ is still considered in alpha stage and parts of the code base might be refactored several times. As a general guideline, we will try to keep the explanations section matching any minor version number update. Currently, _ECellDive_ versioning follows the classic format **vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-stage**. Hence, a release update from **v0.11.5-alpha** to **v0.11.6-alpha** will not contain an update of this section. A release update from **v0.11.5-alpha** to **v0.12.X-alpha** or above will, however.

In this section, we will try to answer the following questions:
- [What are the general coding guidelines?](./about_code.md)
- [How are action modules implemented?](./about_modules.md)
- [How to add new modules?](./about_modules.md#general-workflow-to-create-a-new-module)
- How works the multiplayer code? (coming soon)
- How is the main scene structured? (coming soon)
- How works the _Dive Scene_ system? (coming soon)
- How works the input & interaction systems? (coming soon)
- [What makes a _Player_?](./about_player.md)
- What makes the UI menu? (coming soon)
- and probably others...

Don't hesitate [to start an issue](https://github.com/ecell/ECell_Dive/issues) if you have other questions that would be like to be answered here.
