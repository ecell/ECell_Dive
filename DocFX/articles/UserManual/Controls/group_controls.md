## Groups
This is a set of controls to define custom groups of elements in the Dive Scenes which will be recognizable by color and accessible in the [Groups Menu](/articles/UserManual/UIMenus/groups_menu.html). There are two alternative selectors to build custom groups:
- Ray selector. Adds elements one-by-one to the group being built. Point at the element with the ray and press the *Front Trigger*
- Volumetric Selector. Uses a sphere as the selector. Any elements that collides with the sphere while the *Front Trigger* is pressed are added (removed) from the group if they are not already in it (if already in it). Scale and position of the sphere can be controlled using the *Joystick*.

It is not possible to modify the content of a group (remove od add elements) once it has been created.
