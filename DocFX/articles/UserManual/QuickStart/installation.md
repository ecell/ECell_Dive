## ECellDive
ECellDive runs on the Meta Quest 2. The .apk file can be downloaded from the release page and installed on any Quest 2 heasdset thanks to [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/).

## Kosmogora
To work properly, ECellDive needs [Kosmogora](https://github.com/ecell/Kosmogora). It is a server to which the user can connect in ECellDive to import data, request calculations and save modification files. To properly communicate, the computer running *Kosmogora* and the Meta Quest 2 headset **must be on the same local network**; preferably the same router but a VPN might also work. When both are runing (see [Kosmogora](https://github.com/ecell/Kosmogora) page for details on how to launch the server), you can access the server from ECellDive with different modules in-app.
