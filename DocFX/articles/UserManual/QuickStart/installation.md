## ECellDive
ECellDive runs on the Meta Quest 2. The .apk file can be downloaded from the release page and installed on any Quest 2 heasdset thanks to [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/).

## Answer_talker
To work properly, ECellDive needs [answer_talker](https://github.com/ecell/answer_talker). It is a server to which the user can connect in ECellDive to import data, request calculations and save modification files. To properly communicate, the computer running *answer_talker* and the Meta Quest 2 headset **must be on the same local network**; preferably the same router but a VPN might also work. When both are runing (see [answer_talker](https://github.com/ecell/answer_talker) page for details on how to launch the server), you can access the server from ECellDive with different modules in-app.
