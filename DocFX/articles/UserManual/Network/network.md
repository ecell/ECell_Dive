# Network
The basic setup for a user in ECellDive is to be connected to a network by WiFi. Through this network, the user will be able to reach other users as well as instances of Kosmogora.
Currently, ECellDive **DO NOT** enable connections through the internet as this would require external server resources notably to manage the connection between multiple users.
