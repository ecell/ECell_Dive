# API
The documentation of the source code of the Unity Project to build ECellDive.

This API documentation is currently provided for exhaustiveness but is still lacking. You should consider it as a partial support in case you wish to copy part of the project for yourself or know how this or that was implemented. But it will be hard to completely rely on this documentation (currently) if you want to contribute to the project independantly.
