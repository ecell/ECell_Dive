## General
There are three sets of controls in ECellDive which can be used in either the left or the right controller.
You can switch between a control set to another by pressing the *Y Button* on the left controller and the *B Button* on the right controller. By pressing the aforementioned buttons, the the controls will circle through *Groups Controls*-->*Movement Controls*-->*Ray-based Interaction Controls* on the corresponding controller.

When a user is dropped in the root Dive Scene, the left controller will use the *Ray-based Interaction Controls* and the right controller will use the *Movement Controls*. 
*Groups Controls* and *Movement controls* each have 2 alternative modes. A user can switch between them by pressing the *X Button* on the left controller and the *A Button* on the right controller.

For each control set, the effect of the buttons are clearly visible in-app thanks to little tags attached to the 3D models of the controllers.
