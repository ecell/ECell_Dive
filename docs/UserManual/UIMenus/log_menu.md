## Log Menu
The menu to follow what the application is doing. There are different types of messages that are defined internally during development and can be filtered by the user. Clicking on a message displays extended content but only the 450 first characters are displayed for performances reasons. **KNOWN ISSUE: the filtering of the message do not repositions the message in the scroll list.**
